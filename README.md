# ♻️ Waste Classifier - AI Image Recognition App

This is an AI-powered web application that classifies waste images as **Organic** or **Recyclable** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and served via Gradio.

## 🔍 Overview

Many people struggle with proper waste disposal. This simple AI app helps users understand if a waste item is **organic** (like food or compost) or **recyclable** (like plastic or paper).

- Built in Python with TensorFlow & Gradio
- Classifies images of waste with a trained CNN model
- Can be run locally or deployed to Hugging Face Spaces
